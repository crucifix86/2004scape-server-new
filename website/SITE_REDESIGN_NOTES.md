### Database Changes
- Added `news` table for news articles
- No changes to existing tables
- Settings table is optional (homepage handles missing table)

### Styling Approach
- Modern dark theme (#0a0a0a background)
- Gold accents (#ffd700) for important elements
- Gradient backgrounds for cards/sections
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Smooth hover transitions

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Hiscores** - Currently just shows player list, needs proper skill tracking implementation
2. **Settings Table** - Optional, site works without it but uses default values
3. **Old Pages** - Some pages in `/ex/` folder still have old styling

## Backup Files Created
- `index.php.backup_20250801_101511` - Original homepage
- `rules_old.php` - Original rules page
- `geting-started_old.php` - Original getting started page

## Next Steps (Future Improvements)
- Implement actual hiscores tracking
- Update remaining help pages in `/ex/` folder
- Add more admin features (player search, etc.)
- Consider adding Discord integration
- Mobile app considerations
