4. **Performance**: Browsers can cache the CSS file
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new pages with consistent look

## üîß Shared CSS Components

The consolidated CSS file includes:
- Header with navigation and logo

- Page title sections
- Cards and content sections

- Buttons (primary, secondary, CTA)

## üìù Notes

### Admin Panel
The admin panel pages still use inline styles. These were not updated because:
- Admin panel has different design requirements
- Separate styling helps distinguish admin from public areas
- Would require more extensive refactoring

### Future Improvements
1. Consider creating `admin-style.css` for admin pages
2. Add CSS variables for easier theme customization
3. Consider CSS minification for production
4. Add print styles if needed
